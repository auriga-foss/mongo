# MongoDB (v6.2) for KasperskyOS

This is a fork of [MongoDB project][1] adapted for usage with KasperskyOS. For
more information about the target OS, please refer to [KasperskyOS Community
Edition][2].

For general information on using MongoDB, its features and so on, please see
the [MongoDB website][3].

Please refer to the original MongoDB (parent) [README.md][4] (also available in
the current repository as [README.mongo.md](./README.mongo.md)) for more
details not related to this fork.

## How to build (Linux host or using Docker)

### Brief

There are 2 ways to build and run MongoDB under KOS:

- using host environment;
- using docker.

Docker is much easier to use because it takes responsibility for preparing the
build environment: KOS SDK, python, pip, etc.  
It will also allow you to keep your host environment clean.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have met the following requirements:

#### Build in host environment

- You have Debian GNU/Linux "Buster" 10 x64 or above;
- You have installed the latest version of [KasperskyOS Community Edition][5];
- You met the [MongoDB build](./docs/building.md) requirements;

#### Build using docker

- You have installed docker;
- You have successfully built a docker image with KOS MongoDB build environment;

To build the Docker image, run
[kos/docker/build-image.sh](kos/docker/build-image.sh).  
To create and run a Docker container from the image created in the previous
step, run
[kos/docker/create-and-run-container.sh](kos/docker/create-and-run-container.sh).

### Build

Building in a host or docker environment is the same.

Run `make help` to get a list of all available targets.

#### QEMU image

1. `cd <repo_root>/kos/mongod/`;
2. `make compile-mongod`;
3. `make qemubuild`;
4. `make qemurun`;
5. **mongod** is running on KOS QEMU and listening on localhost:`MONGOD_PORT`
port (default 27018).

#### HW (RaspberryPi) image

1. `cd <repo_root>/kos/mongod/`;
2. `make compile-mongod`;
3. `make hwbuild`;  
   Resulting image path: *<target_arch>/einit/kos-image*;
4. [Prepare][6] SD Card for RaspberryPi;
5. Copy the image to the SD card;
6. Turn on your Raspberry Pi. Communication is implemented via UART;
7. Using a COM terminal (minicom or otherwise), run the following command after
starting u-boot (assuming that your `num` partition is formatted to ext4):

```
U-Boot> ext4load mmc 0:<partition_num> 0x200000 kos-image
...
U-Boot> bootelf 0x200000

```

## Directory structure

- *kos* - directory with KOS related stuff;
  - *docker* - Docker files and helper scripts;
    - *Dockerfile* - dockerfile to create a Docker image with KOS CE SDK
      installed and MongoDB build requirements;
    - *build-image.sh* - example command to create a Docker image;
    - *create-and-run-container.sh* - example command to create and run a
      Docker container from a previously created image;
  - *mongod* - project to run **mongod** under KOS OS;
    - *einit*, *mongod* - sources and CMake build rules for corresponding
      entities;
    - *resources* - description files for all the entities, additional files to
      place in the resulting image;
      - *edl* - entities *.edl description files;
      - *image* - additional files to place in the resulting image;
    - *CMakeLists.txt* - project-level CMake build rules;
    - *Makefile* - main Makefile to configure/build/run MongoDB project for KOS;
  - *mongo-tests* - project to run **mongod unit-tests** under KOS OS;
    - *einit*, *test_runner* - sources and CMake build rules for corresponding
      entities;
    - *resources* - description files for all the entities, additional files to
      place in the resulting image;
      - *edl* - entities *.edl description files;
      - *image* - additional files to place in the resulting image;
    - *CMakeLists.txt* - project-level CMake build rules;
    - *Makefile* - main Makefile to configure/build/run mongod unit-tests for KOS;
  - *patches* - optional patches for MongoDB KOS;

## Known issues and limitations

**Currently, only the mongod (server daemon) build is supported for KOS**.

1. **IPv6** is not yet supported at the moment, as it's not available in KOS for
now;
2. Subprocess creation isn't available in KOS for now;
3. Only static build of MongoDB is supported (dynamic libraries are not
supported by KOS);
4. Mongo **mozjs** JS engine is disabled;
5. Mongo HTTP client & Free Monitoring are disabled (no **libcurl** in KOS CE);

## How to run tests

To run mongod unit-tests, there is a special **mongod unit-tests** project,
located in *kos/mongo-tests* directory. In result of building process, all
unit-test executables will be placed on the SD Card image. To limit the number
of running unit-tests, `CHOSEN_TESTS` variable must be populated with the list
of desired unit-tests (empty variable will cause running of all unit-tests). 
To obtain the list of all available unit-tests, `make list-tests` must be
executed.

### QEMU image

1. `cd <repo_root>/kos/mongo-tests/`;
2. `make compile-mongo-tests`;
3. `CHOSEN_TESTS = "<list of desired tests>" make qemubuild`;
4. `make qemurun`.

### HW (RaspberryPi) image

1. `cd <repo_root>/kos/mongo-tests/`;
2. `make compile-mongo-tests`;
3. `CHOSEN_TESTS = "<list of desired tests>" make hwbuild`;
4. Prepare SD Card:
    1. Insert SD Ð¡ard and run the command below to format it with two partitions
(1st partition for u-boot loader and the 2nd for tests and supporting
files):  
`dd if=<repo_root>/kos/mongo-tests/build-aarch64/sdcard0.img of=/dev/mmcblk<num> status=progress`
    2. [Install u-boot to the 1st partition][6];
    3. Copy `kos-image` to the any partition of SD Card:  
    `cp <repo_root>/kos/mongo-tests/build-aarch64/einit/kos-image <path_to_sd_partition>`
5. Turn on your Raspberry Pi. Communication is implemented via UART;
6. Using a COM terminal (minicom or otherwise), run the following command after
starting u-boot (assuming that your `num` partition is formatted to fat32):
```
U-Boot> fatload mmc 0:<partition_num> 0x200000 kos-image
...
U-Boot> bootelf 0x200000
```

## Current tests status
